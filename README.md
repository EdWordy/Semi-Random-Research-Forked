# CM_Semi_Random_Research
Semi Random Research gives the player three research random research options to choose from. Settings allow the player to reroll the options if desired, to increase or decrease the number of research projects, and to automatically select the next research project after each completion. There is a setting to disable the feature so that it can be bypassed temporarily without having to remove and readd the mod to a save.
	
The options appear in the "Next Research" tab, near the original "Research" tab. This allows for compatibility with mods like ResearchPal that override the original mod tab.
